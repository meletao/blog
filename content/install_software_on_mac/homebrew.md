# Homebrew

`Homebrew` is a package manager software that lets you install other softwares/packages. To install it, run:

```zsh

```

To check if it is installed properly, run:
```zsh

You can search [here](https://brew.sh/) for softwares that you want to install. I **strongly** recommend downloading softwares with `Homebrew` if they are available.
